<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>The color palette is a cornerstone of Asana, giving the product an immediate sense of being familiar and warm. The color palette leverages Asana&rsquo;s brand heritage, and builds on its sense of energy, intelligence and confidence. It adds warmth and a human touch.</p>

<p>Asana is committed to complying with AA standard contrast ratios for all text that is not &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;. The color combinations in this guide don&rsquo;t comply with the AA standard just yet. Make sure you don&rsquo;t rely on color alone to convey state or meaning.</p>
